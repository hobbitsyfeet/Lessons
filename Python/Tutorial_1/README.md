HELLO WORLD. The starting of most programming languages. Here, we will execute some basic commands and explore the syntax of python.
    
    #HOW TO RUN Hello_World.py
    
    #Let's see this code in action! Either copy this file, or entire contents and try to execute it.
    #We can do this by using the python comand we installed earlier.

    #Go into the directory of where you have this file. For example: I would have this in Github/Lessons/Tutorial_1/
    #When we are in this folder on the command line (if you have troubles, just type 
    #'cd' with a space after it, and drag and drop the file in, then hit enter)
    #type 'python Hello_Wold.py' and watch your code run!


This is not super in depth, nor will teach you everyting you need to know. Though, it's a good brief start.
A lot of people get annoyed or bored on the basics, when in reality this is just something you pick up
when you are putting it to use. You learn new things when they're needed and you remember it for the same
problem again later. 

For more indepth stuff, either look at https://docs.python.org/fr/3.6/ or https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp are both good.
